-- Remove Duplicates then removing COLUMNs
-- standard practise is to do delete columns
-- removing duplicate ROWs, create a CTE

WITH RowNumCTE AS(
SELECT *,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
	PARTITION BY ParcelID,

				 SalePrice,

--order by ParcelID
)

Select *
From RowNumCTE
Where row_num > 1
Order by PropertyAddress



Select *
From Nashville
-- check if the duplicates are gone 


-- Delete Unused Columns
-- better option would be hide data or work with a duplicate file of the data before we even think of deleting COLUMNS


Select *
From Nashville

---- other SQl dont accept a single detele script, so delete colums indivdually
